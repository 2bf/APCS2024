# 1.1.4 - Average

Objective: to understand how different-precision data types work together. To format output to specifications.

What you need to do: write a simple program which reads 3 integers from the user and prints out their average, correctly rounded to the nearest thousandth, something like this:
```
Enter three integers: 5 11 25
The average is 13.667
```
The easiest way to get that formatted output is to use System.out.printf, which was explained in video 1.1f.

Advanced version: do the formatting not by using System.out.printf, but rather by using typecasting and arithmetic computation (how you would do this is up to you to determine).

Turn in: your .java file, containing your main method.
