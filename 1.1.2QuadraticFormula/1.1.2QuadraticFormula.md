# 1.1.2 – Quadratic Formula
AP Computer Science A 

Objective: to be able to read data from the user, compute with it, print results, and use if-else statements.

What you need to do: Write a program to use the quadratic formula to solve quadratic equations. You should prompt the user to enter the coefficients (a, b, and c) in a quadratic equation and print the solutions using the quadratic formula. Some things to keep in mind:
- Coefficients should be input at doubles.
- You do not need to check your input to screen out things that are not numbers.
- You might find it easier to use the version of the quadratic formula where the formula is split into two fractions rather than one.
- There is no native exponentiation operator. To square b, you could use Math.pow(b,2) but for small powers, I find b * b to be simpler.

Your program must print out two answers if the answers are real. Sample output:
```
Enter a: 1
Enter b: 3
Enter c: -10
Solutions are 2.0000 and -5.0000
```
If the discriminant is less than zero, you have a choice:
Basic version: print out an error stating that the roots are non-real. Sample outputs:
```
Enter a: 1
Enter b: 3
Enter c: 10
Error: non-real solutions
```
Advanced version: print out the solutions as complex numbers. Sample output:
```
Enter a: 1
Enter b: 3
Enter c: 10
Solutions are -1.5000 + 2.7839i and -1.5000 – 2.7839i
Turn in: Your .java file, containing your code. Everything should be in the main method.
