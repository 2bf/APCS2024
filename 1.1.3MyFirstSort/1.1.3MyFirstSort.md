# 1.1.3 – My First Sort
AP Computer Science A

Objective: Read data from user, design a basic algorithm

What you need to do: Read three pieces of data from the user and print them in order. There are a number of ways in which you could do this. For example, you could read them into three variables, swap around the data in those variables, and then print the variables in a specified order which never changes. Or, you could compare the values in the variables and then print them in an order chosen based on their values.

The important thing is that you do this yourself. If you wish to put the data into a small array and sort it by implementing a sorting algorithm that you know and understand yourself, that’s fine.

You may NOT use Arrays.sort or any other sorting method written by someone else.

When designing an algorithm, I highly recommend diagramming your method on paper before beginning to code. But I’ve only been programming since 1981, what do I know?

Basic version: Read three integers from the user and print them in ascending order:
```
Enter an integer: 7
Enter another integer: 2
Enter one more integer: 4
In order: 2 4 7

Enter an integer: 9
Enter another integer: 5
Enter one more integer: 9
In order: 5 9 9
```
Advanced version: Read three Strings from the user and print them in alphabetical order (yes, you may use
comparison methods from the String class):
```
Enter a word: lettuce
Enter another word: bacon
Enter one more word: tomato
In order: bacon lettuce tomato
```

Turn in: your .java file, containing your code.
