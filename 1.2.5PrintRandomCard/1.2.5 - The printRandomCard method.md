# 1.2.5 – The ```printRandomCard``` Method

Objective: To work with a random number generator, select from a list based on choice

What you need to do: Write and test a method

```public static void printRandomCard()```

which selects a card at random from a standard 52-card deck and prints it to the screen. Each of the 52 cards must have an equal chance of being picked. Successive calls to the method might look like this:
```
8 of spades
Ace of hearts
Queen of diamonds
10 of clubs
2 of hearts
```

etc. Of course, the same card could come up more than once.

Advanced version: modify the method header to
```
public static void printRandomCard(int numJokers)
```
to allow for the possibility of a number of jokers having been added to the pack. This one is tricky! Let’s say that numJokers is 1. In the basic version, you could pick the rank and suit independently of one another. In this version, you need to account for the fact that the probability of picking a joker is 1 in 53. If a joker is picked, your code should just print joker.

Turn in: The .java file containing your printRandomCard method and your testing code in the main method. Yes, your testing code is probably just printRandomCard();, unless you went for the advanced version.
