# 1.5.5 â€“ Alphabetical Arrays of Strings

Objective: To work with arrays of ```Strings```. To develop a basic algorithm. To practice using the ```compareTo``` (or ```compareToIgnoreCase```) methods.

What you need to do: Write and test the method
```public static boolean isAlphabetical(String[] words)```
which should return ```true``` if all the ```Strings``` in the array are in ascending order, from beginning to end. Repeated ```Strings``` are acceptable (see examples below). Note that ordering should be case-insensitive, but otherwise ordering is determined by the result of the ```compareTo``` method in the ```String``` class. Actually, since this is case-insensitive, I highly recommend that you use the ```compareToIgnoreCase``` method instead.

Here are some examples:
|```words```|```return value```|
|-|-|
|```["A", "car", "drove", "fast"]```|true```|
|```["A", "cat", "ran", "fast"]```|```false```|
|```["He", "read", "4", "words"]```|```false (digits come before letters in Unicode)```|
|```["I'm", "really", "really", "tired"]```|```true (they're still in order)```|
|```["tomato"]```|```true (it's not out of order)```|
|```[]```|```true (see previous line)```|

Turn in: Your ```.java``` file, along with your main method (may I recommend use of the ```split``` method fromthe ```String``` class to simplify user input?)
