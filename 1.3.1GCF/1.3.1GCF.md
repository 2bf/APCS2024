# 1.3.1 - GCF
Objective: Use a looping structure to solve a basic math problem

What you need to do: Write and test a method
```
//precondition: a > 0, b > 0
public static int gcf(int a, int b)
```
which returns the greatest common factor of its two arguments. As a reminder, the GCF is the largest positive integer which divides evenly into both numbers. Here are some sample calls and return values:

Call ``gcf(6, 8)`` returns ``2``

Call ``gcf(3, 15)`` returns ``3``

Call ``gcf(39, 91)`` returns ``13``

Call ``gcf(1, 350)`` returns ``1``

Call ``gcf(100, 8675309)`` returns ``1``

Call ``gcf(83, 83)`` returns ``83``


For the advanced version, your method should return the GCF, but should utilize the Euclidean Algorithm to do it.

Turn in: Your .java file, containing your method and testing code in the main method.
