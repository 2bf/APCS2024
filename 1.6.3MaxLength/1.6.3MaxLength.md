# 1.6.3 â€“ Max Length

Objective: To solve an algorithmic problem involving 2-D arrays with only the specification (no hints) and write a method to be used in the next assignment.

What you need to do: Write and test the method
```
//Returns the length (in characters) of the longest number in table
//precondition: table contains at least one element
public static int maxLength(int[][] table)
```
This method should return the number of characters in the number in the table that has the largest number of characters. For example, the code
```
int[][] table = {
    {23, 0, 425, -25},
    {1856, 24601, 7, 92},
    {-3, 18, -2053, 13}
};
System.out.println(maxLength(table));
```
would print out 5, since the longest numbers have 5 characters. Note that this would be a tie between the ```24601``` and ```-2053```.

Turn in: your ```.java``` file, containing your ```maxLength``` and ```main``` methods.
