# 1.3.5 â€“ Prime Factorization

Objective: Use a looping structure to construct a prime factorization algorithm. Use a String accumulator to build up a String to be returned by a method.

What you need to do: Write and test the method
```
//precondition: n >= 2
public static String primeFactor(int n)
```

which returns a ```String``` containing the prime factorization of the argument. Here are some sample calls and return values:

| Call | Return Value |
| - | - |
| primeFactor(42) | "2 3 7" |
| primeFactor(12) | "2 2 3" |
| primeFactor(65536) | "2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2" |
| primeFactor(8675309) | "8675309" |

Note that your method must not print anything itself. It must only return a String containing the prime factorization. Try not to have an extra space at the end of your String, as in "2 3 7 ", but if that's the worst error your code has, it's not that big a deal. We can talk in class about how to deal with this.

Turn in: Your ```.java``` file, containing your method and the main method you used to test it.
