# 1.4.1 – Arrays (Part 1)

Objective: To get practice working with arrays.

What you need to do: Write the following 3 methods:


1. ```public static int max(int[] array)```

Pretty straightforward: given an array of integers, it returns the largest/smallest value in the array. This should be done using the “king of the hill” algorithm:
  1. Consider the first element of the array. Since it’s the only one we’ve looked at, it’s the largest/smallest element we’ve looked at so far.
  2. Consider every other element of the array. If any element is larger/smaller than the largest/smallest one we’ve looked at so far, we now have a new largest/smallest element so far.
  3. Once we’ve considered every element in the array, then the largest/smallest one we’ve looked at so far is, ipso facto, the largest/smallest element in the entire array.

If you wish to hard-code your testing code, remember that you can use an array initializer like so:

```int[] numbers = {8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9, 0};```

Passing that array to the max method would return 9. Passing it to the min method would return 0.

2. ```public static int range(int[] array)```

This method, which should be very easy (one line), returns the difference between the largest and smallest elements of the array. So, applied to
```int[] values = {-3, 8, 2, 17, 9, -3, 12, 0, 4, 11};```
the method would return 20.

Turn in: Your .java file, containing the 3 methods above and your testing code.
