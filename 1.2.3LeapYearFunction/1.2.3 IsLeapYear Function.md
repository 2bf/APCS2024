# 1.2.3 â€“ The isLeapYear()Method

Objective: To formulate an algorithm based on specifications, to use the modulus operator to check divisibility, and to utilize the if-else structure to best effect.

What you need to do: Write a function
```
public static boolean isLeapYear(int year)
```
which returns whether or not the year, passed as an argument, is a leap year.

How do we know if a year is a leap year? Well,

- If a year is divisible by 4, it is a leap year, UNLESS

  - it is divisible by 100, in which case it's not a leap year, UNLESS

    - it is divisible by 400, in which case it's a leap year.

Hint: you may or may not wish to apply the conditions above in the order specified.

Turn in: Your ```.java``` file, containing your method and testing code in the main method.
